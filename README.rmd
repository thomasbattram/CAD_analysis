# Analysis of coronary artery disease genetic risk and the metabolome in adolescence

## Description
Files for the analysis of the association between coronary artery disease genetic risk and the metabolome in adolescence using data in ALSPAC

Running Masterfile.R will complete all of the analyses once everything is setup, please note the prerequisites below

## Prerequisites
* Access the genotype and metabolomics data from ALSPAC
* The genotype data should be in dosage (bgen) format - if not parts of the R script will have to be altered 
* Put the genotype and metabolomics data into the "inputs" directory, then rename the files "genotype_data.dta" and "metabolite_data.dta" respectively
* The Individual_variant_analysis.R script needs to be ran once before the New_GRS_analysis.R script
* Within "outputs", directories named "forests", "tables", "heatmaps" and "other" will need to be made if you are to follow the scripts exactly - of course where the results are outputted and the names of the outputs can be easily changed within the scripts
